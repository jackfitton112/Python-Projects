# Notes from video

nodes are points, edges connect the nodes to each other

i.e A ------- B

A and B are nodes and --- is an edge

A* also has weighted edges **---** which are a certain length so weight 1 is less than weight 2, in this example all edges are weight 1 in the grid


A* path finding finds the smallest path between two points, A star is an informed path finder therefore it knows the start and end points and isnt searching blind


the open set is used as a priority queue, the open set keeps a list of what you want to search later, this is stored as F (the distance to the node from the previous node )


should watch the video, its very good,
