# Python Projects!

## This is / will be a collection of my python projects, some will be small others may be larger!

This is in an attempt to learn python, my aim is for projects to start very basic but get more complex over time.


### Projects so far:

##### Number Guesser
The number guesser asks a user to select a number between 0 - 100, in the first iteration (numberguessersimple.py) this is just a set of simple if statements to determine if the number was correct. in the second iteration (numberguesserfunction) i have used a function to determine if the guess is correct
