# Python Projects!

## This is / will be a collection of my python projects, some will be small others may be larger!

This is in an attempt to learn python, my aim is for projects to start very basic but get more complex over time.


### Projects so far:

##### Number Guesser
The number guesser asks a user to select a number between 0 - 100, in the first iteration (numberguessersimple.py) this is just a set of simple if statements to determine if the number was correct. in the second iteration (numberguesserfunction) i have used a function to determine if the guess is correct

##### FizzBuzz
Fizzbuzz is a program that if the number is can be divided by 3 with no remainder will output Fizz and if the number can be divided by 5 with no remainder will output Buzz, if the number can be divided by both 3 and 5 with no remainder then the output is FizzBuzz

##### Password Generator
This password generator allows user to select from 3 options.
- 1. Mixed case letters
- 2. Mixed case letters and numbers
- 3. Mixed case letters, numbers and special characters

with the option to specify length and option to save to file
